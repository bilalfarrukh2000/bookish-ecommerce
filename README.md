# Description
I have built a back end using the Express.js API in order to interact with MySQL database. I have also created a walkthrough video which there are functionalties that are being tested and shown. 
The user uses the latest technology in order for the company to compete with other companies.
When a user enters a command to open the application, then the Sequelize models will be in sync with MySQL Database.
After the user tests the APIs, then the user will have the ability to create, delete, and update the database.
